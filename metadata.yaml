description: Atypical in a canon of socialist messages and stories of struggle against
  indomitable forces, King Midas is a romantic story about two lovers who have been
  cursed by turning whatever they touch into ivy. Biographers of Sinclair have said
  that he was ardently opposed to pre-marital sex. King Midas, in that light, presents
  a unique moral allegory from one of the 20th century's most renowned socialists.
